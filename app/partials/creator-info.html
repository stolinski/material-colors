        I'm a Senior Developer for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.teamdetroit.com/">Team Detroit</a> and formerly a web applications developer for The University of Michigan and the Senior Developer at <a target="_blank" href="http://qltd.com">Q LTD</a> in Ann Arbor, MI. I also do freelance web design and development for projects that I find interesting, challenging or exciting, and give private training or consulting in various web topics.

        I also enjoy bboying also known as breakdancing, and have been dancing for over 8 years doing shows for professional NFL and NBA teams. I'm inspired by a hot cup of green tea, excellent music, and Shaw Bros. kung fu movies.
